# Custom VirtualBox Malware Analysis System

## 🎯 Overview

We'll create a custom malware analysis solution using your existing VirtualBox Windows 10 VM. This approach gives us:
- ✅ **Full control** over the analysis environment
- ✅ **Python 3 compatibility** throughout
- ✅ **Custom feature extraction** tailored for our ML pipeline
- ✅ **No deprecated dependencies**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: VM Controller (30 minutes)
- Control VM lifecycle (start, stop, reset, snapshot)
- File transfer to/from VM
- Command execution in VM

### Phase 2: Monitoring Agents (1 hour)
- Install monitoring scripts in Windows 10 VM
- Track file system changes
- Monitor network connections
- Log system events

### Phase 3: Analysis Pipeline (1 hour)
- Submit files for analysis
- Collect behavioral data
- Generate structured reports

### Phase 4: ML Integration (30 minutes)
- Parse analysis reports
- Extract features for ML models
- Integrate with existing ML pipeline

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install VirtualBox Python API

```powershell
# Install VirtualBox SDK for Python
pip install vboxapi pyvbox

# Install additional monitoring tools
pip install psutil watchdog requests
pip install pyautogui pillow  # For screenshot capture
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Windows 10 VM

What's the name of your Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox? We'll need:
- **VM Name**: (e.g., "Windows10-Analysis")
- **Username**: For VM login
- **Password**: For VM login
- **Network Settings**: Current configuration

### Step 3: VM Preparation Checklist

In your Windows 10 VM, we'll need to:
- [ ] Install Python 3.8+ 
- [ ] Disable Windows Defender (temporarily for analysis)
- [ ] Configure file sharing with host
- [ ] Install our monitoring agents
- [ ] Create clean snapshot for resets

## 💡 Advantages of This Approach

### Technical Benefits:
- ✅ **Modern stack** - Pure Python 3
- ✅ **Custom features** - Extract exactly what we need for ML
- ✅ **Lightweight** - No complex framework overhead
- ✅ **Flexible** - Easy to modify and extend

### Academic Benefits:
- ✅ **Novel approach** - Custom solution demonstrates innovation
- ✅ **Full control** - Complete understanding of analysis process
- ✅ **Reproducible** - Documented methodology
- ✅ **Scalable** - Can analyze multiple samples efficiently

## 🛠️ What We'll Build

### Core Components:

1. **VM Controller**
   ```python
   vm = VMController("Windows10-Analysis")
   vm.start()
   vm.copy_file("malware.exe", "/temp/sample.exe")
   vm.execute("python analysis_agent.py /temp/sample.exe")
   report = vm.get_report()
   vm.reset_to_snapshot("clean")
   ```

2. **Behavioral Monitor**
   - File system changes (created, modified, deleted files)
   - Registry modifications
   - Network connections
   - Process creation/termination
   - System API calls

3. **Feature Extractor**
   - Static PE analysis + Dynamic behavioral data
   - Custom feature vectors for ML training
   - Automated report generation

4. **ML Pipeline Integration**
   - Direct integration with SVM/Random Forest models
   - Real-time classification
   - Performance metrics and evaluation

## 🎯 Immediate Benefits

This approach allows us to:
- **Start immediately** with your existing VM
- **Control every aspect** of the analysis
- **Generate real behavioral data** (not simulated)
- **Create a working prototype** quickly
- **Demonstrate technical innovation** in your FYP

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Gather VM Details** - Name, credentials, current state
2. **Install VM Controller** - Python VirtualBox integration
3. **Deploy Monitoring Agents** - Analysis scripts in VM
4. **Test Analysis Pipeline** - Start with benign samples
5. **Process Malware Dataset** - Analyze your 200 samples
6. **Train ML Models** - Use extracted behavioral features

**Estimated time to working system: 3-4 hours**
